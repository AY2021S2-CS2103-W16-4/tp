## Project: EZManage

EZManage - EZManage is a desktop address book application used for the management of a tuition centre's sessions, students and tutors. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete a session.
  * What it does: Allows the user to delete an existing session in EZManage at a time. 
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can easily manage the list of sessions and allows the app should to provide a convenient way to remove sessions when mistakenly added or when the session is no longer needed.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. 
  * Credits: AddressBook Level 3
