## Project: EZManage

EZManage - EZManage is a desktop address book application used for the management of a tuition centre's sessions, students and tutors. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add a session.
  * What it does: Allows the user to add a new session to EZManage. 
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a person may drop out of a session at any time and the app should give the user a convenient way to update the session assignment to reflect this.
  * Highlights: This enhancement modified the structure of the original AddressBook to be a solution for the problem domain tackled by EZManage. It affects commands to be added in future and required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. It also required writing of additional tests to ensure the sessions feature worked before passing the product on to other members.
  * Credits: AddressBook Level 3

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to unassign a person from a session.
  * What it does: Allows the user to unassign a person from a session in EZManage.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a person may drop out of a session at any time and the app should give the user a convenient way to update the session assignment to reflect this.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
